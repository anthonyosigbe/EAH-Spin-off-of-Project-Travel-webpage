  <h2>Fact file</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Fiji is made up of 333 islands and many tiny islets. Two thirds of Fiji’s islands remain uninhabited.</li>
      <li>The name Fiji is an adaptation of the Tongan pronunciation of “Viti”, originally written by Europeans as “Feejee”.</li>
      <li> Only four of Fiji’s 27 airports have paved runways.</li>
      <li>Of a total population of nearly 875,000, around 512,000 are ethnic Fijians, 290,000 Fiji-Indians and the remainder Chinese, Europeans and various Pacific islanders.</li>
      <li>At New Year on the islands, women play a game called veicaqe moli – “kick the orange”. The winners have to give new clothes to the losers, and the losers’ job is to serve the victors yaqona.</li>
      <li> Around a fifth of ethnic Fijians live a mostly subsistence lifestyle on tribally owned native land (87 percent of all land in the country).</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Underwater Fiji</h2>
    <p>A huge part of Fiji’s appeal lies below the surface of the waves. Don a mask and snorkel and you will find coral reefs shimmering with colourful fish, sea fans dancing in the current and manta rays and reef sharks cruising the lagoons. Throw in crystal-clear water and temperatures that rarely fall below 25°C and you have one of the world’s greatest snorkeling and diving destinations.<br>

    Fiji’s ten thousand square kilometers of coral reef twist and turn around every island, and include the world’s third longest barrier reef – the 200km-long Great Sea Reef found off the north coast of Vanua Levu. These amazing structures provide habitats for thousands of species of fish, plants and animals and boast an astonishing biodiversity that’s comparable to that found in rainforests.<br>
    
    The three most common types of reef found in Fiji are fringing reefs, which are attached to an island and offer snorkeling direct from the shore; patch reefs, individual coral reefs found within a lagoon and usually attracting great numbers of reef fish; and barrier reefs, which are separated from the shore by a deep channel and feature steep drop-offs and strong currents. There’s information on Fiji’s best reefs, plus snorkeling and diving advice.</p>

      <p>Fijian cuisine includes plenty of locally caught bony reef fish cooked in rich coconut cream, and sometimes kai mussels, mud   crabs and even lobster, but little meat except for slow-cooked pig (taro) on a special occasion. When the seas are rough or the   season’s pickings are slender, Fijians resort to imported fatty mutton and tinned corned beef, the latter perceived as something of a delicacy and often served up by the carton at ceremonial functions.<br>

        Appearing at every mealtime is a hefty portion of starchy rootcrop, either cassava (a bland and extremely dry tuber), dalo (known as taro in Polynesia, a large corn) or yams (huge tubers, sometimes two metres long, and the most flavoursome of the three rootcrops). Vegetables are less common, with the most popular being bele, a green, sometimes slimy, leaf, and rourou, the leaf of the dalo crop which if cooked too quickly causes an itchy sensation to the throat. The availability of fruit is dependent on the season.<br>
        
        <strong>Traditional Fijian dishes include:</strong> kokoda, made from a large fish, usually tuna or wahoo, chopped into chunks, marinated overnight in lime juice and chillies, seasoned with coconut cream and served cold; palusami, coconut cream wrapped up in the leaf of dalo and slow cooked (delicious); and the kids’ favourite vakalolo, a sticky pudding made from cassava mixed with sugar and thick coconut cream and best served with ice cream and bananas. Fish in lolo (coconut cream) with cassava or dalo is served as counter food in most high-street restaurants, but finding the more delicate dishes of kokoda, palusami, vakalolo or lovo suckling pig is more challenging: Nadina in Nadi and Old Mill Cottage in Suva are two of the few restaurants serving traditional Fijian cuisine.<br>
        
        <strong>Fiji-Indians</strong> tend to be more adventurous in taste, relying on home-cooked curries, often made of freshly picked vegetables seasoned with hot chillies and other spices, accompanied by home-made chutney but usually drowned in oil or ghee.

  <h2>Travel advice for Travel Guide Fiji</h2>
   <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p>For travellers most items will appear very affordable, especially public transport, dining out and buying local food. If frugal, you can survive on F$70 (£22/€27/US$37) per day, staying in dorms, preparing your own meals and travelling on public transport. Stay in private rooms and eat out regularly and you’ll need around F$180 (£60/€70/US$96), although extras such as alcohol, car rental, scuba diving and sightseeing tours will all add to your costs. Travelling around the two largest islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu offers the best value, with prices on the outer islands usually inflated by at least 20 percent. Note that <strong>tipping</strong> is not expected and in traditional Fijian society causes embarrassment.<br>

        <strong>Hostel accommodation</strong> will set you back around F$40 a person for a dorm bed, or F$85 per person including meals at the popular Yasawa backpacker resorts. Town hotel rooms start from around F$70, with double or twin rooms often the same price as a single. A moderate beach resort starts from F$200 for a room, the more popular holiday resorts cost from F$350 and a luxury boutique resort will set you back anything from F$500 to over F$2000 per night.<br>
        
        <strong>Food</strong> on the whole is reasonably cheap, with local produce offering by far the best value, especially when purchased from the roadside or at municipal markets. Supermarket shelves tend to be dominated by more expensive imported food items, mostly canned and restricted in variety. Dining out is affordable, with cheap restaurant counter food costing from F$5 a serving, and main dishes ordered from a menu from F$9 to F$25; resort restaurants are invariably more expensive.<br>
        
        <strong>Travelling</strong> around Viti Levu by public transport is especially cheap, with the five-hour journey from Nadi to Suva costing just F$22, and local journeys starting from 80 cents. Visiting the offshore or outer islands is going to eat up a larger chunk of your budget. For example, the hop-on, hop-off boat pass along the Yasawas costs F$191 for seven days; and a domestic flight to Taveuni can cost up to F$250 one way, although discounted fares are usually available via airline websites and can almost match passenger ferry rates, which cost from F$65 between Suva and Taveuni.<br>
        
        Every traveller over twelve years of age departing Fiji pays a <strong>departure tax</strong> of F$200, although this is pre-paid in the cost of your airline ticket.</p>
