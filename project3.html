  <h1 class="header">How I Started My Software Engineering  Journey with ehealth Africa <br> By Anthony Azubike Osigbe</h1>


  <p>In this blog, I'll share my ongoing learning experience and How I started my Software Engineering journey with a glimpse at some of my projects and courses/resources that I followed in this journey and few tips from my side if you are aiming towards the Software Engineering domain.</p>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>

  <p>I'm Anthony Osigbe, a software developer in training  Currently pursuing my software engineering profession under eHealth Africa,  Besides this, I am a graduate of Environmental science and resource management Bsc.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>I used to go the internet cafe when I was way younger and I used to ask many questions on how things usually work and when I see the design on yahoomail I used to ask myself how does this thing get to work and who designed it? fast forward then I came to know about this web stuff at the end of my university days and decided to take a dive into web development before the lockdown two years ago but I tried all I could to get into coding but I couldn't. By the way, I was never into this coding or any HTML stuff in my school life or life in general.<br> fast foward to present day I saw on facebook an advert for those that want to learn software engineering on <a href="https://www.ehealthafrica.org/">eHealth Africa </a> requesting to be part of the Journey to learn for free  and I applied sat for the apptitude test and I got into the ehealth Academy </p>

  <h2>How I started?</h2>
  
  <p id="my-journey">I started my journey by learning HTML5 and CSS3 in parallel from <a href="https://elearning.ehealthafrica.org/">Ehealth Academy</a>.<br> (Tip: Don't Try to learn everything in the first go it's an ongoing process)<br>

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WMGqA9T2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6xyqhmd1lh1v7u1a139c.png" alt="Html-css image"> 
  </p>

 

  <p>And wrote my first HTML script and uploaded it to github <a href="https://github.com/anthonyosigbe">github/anthonyosigbe</a> with the basic knowledge I got in two weeks from the <a href="https://elearning.ehealthafrica.org/">Ehealth Academy elearning site</a> linked with <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">khan Academy</a>.<br>
  I am still in the process of learning and so far it has been fun for me and I have increased in the knowledge of what I dont know and it is getting more exciting and interesting 
  </p>

  <h2>Few of my Projects undertaken now</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Spin-off Project: Travel webpage <a href="https://github.com/anthonyosigbe/EAH-Spin-off-of-Projects">My travel web page</a></li>

    <li>Recipe book <a href="https://github.com/anthonyosigbe/EAH-Spin-off-of-Projects">My Recipe book</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> These websites that are built by me (and also which are awful and beautiful at the same time) are stored locally/on git and No One has seen it before, so you are lucky to see all these. I know that newbie developers also have these kind of websites stored privately ;)</p>
