  <h1>Cooking Light Fresh Food Fast 24/7 5 Ingredient, 15 minute recipes</h1>

  <h2 id="welcome" style="color: black;">Welcome</h2>
  <p><strong>Enjoy fresh, fast food every meal of the day.</strong>This latest cookbook in the Cooking Light
    Fresh Food Fast series makes it even easier to celebrate a healthy lifestyle 24 hours a day,
    7 days a week. We often hear from readers and parents who are eager to feed their families
    good food around the clock. There’s a growing national movement focused on healthy
    lunches for schoolchildren, and recent research confirms that breakfast truly is the most
    important meal of the day. Cooking Light Fresh Food Fast 24/7 helps you make fresh,
    healthy, and delicious food a bigger part of how you eat.<br>

    <strong>In this new collection of 280 5-ingredient, 15-minute recipes,</strong> we’ve created flavor-ful,
    easy dinners fit for sharing with family and friends. You’ll also find ideas for breakfast
    and lunch on the go, brunch, and fun snacks, plus appetizers and cocktails for entertaining.
    Each Test Kitchen–rated recipe meets at least one of two criteria: It calls for 5 ingredients
    or fewer (excluding water, flour, cooking spray, oil, salt, pepper, and optional ingredients),
    or it can be prepared in 15 minutes or less. Many accomplish both!<br>

    <strong>Plus—we’ve made life easier with a new section: Market to Meal Planners.</strong> Each
    planner gives you one shopping list for nine recipes, including three dinners. Recipes in
    each planner share common ingredients, so you can make the most of the food you buy.<br>

    Cooking Light Fresh Food Fast 24/7 includes other new features, such as:

    <ul>
      <li> <strong>“Feed Four for $10 or Less”</strong> helps stretch your dollar with budget meals. (Prices were derived from midsized-city supermarkets in Summer 2011. Side dishes are included in the cost of the meal. Salt, pepper, and cooking spray are
        freebies.)
    </li>

    <li><strong>“To-Go Tips”</strong>offer ways to pack a portable meal so it stays fresh.</li>
    <li><strong>“Switch It Up”</strong>shows you how to turn a salad recipe into a sandwich, or a sandwich recipe into a salad—essentially giving you a new dish to try!</li>
    </ul>

    All the recipes are designed to get you in and out of the kitchen in minutes. It’s never been easier to enjoy good food every day!<br> The Cooking Light Editors

      <p>We’re skeptical of full-week meal planners because that’s just not realistic for most
        people. Some of us spend evenings chauffeuring carloads of kids to soccer practice and
        play dates. Others cook just for two. Instead, in this new feature of the Cooking Light
        Fresh Food Fast series, we focused on creating 10 meal planners that make enjoying fresh
        food at any meal throughout the week more practical. Each planner includes one shopping
        list for three dinners and a mix of breakfasts, lunches, snacks, and desserts. Cooking three
        nights a week? One planner’s got you covered. If you’re a devoted weeknight cook, you
        can combine two of your favorite planners for six dinners and nearly a week’s worth of
        great meals.
        The shopping lists don’t include the basics: salt, pepper, oil, all-purpose flour, and cooking
        spray (we assume you have those) or optional ingredients. You can download printable
        versions of the planners at CookingLight.com/FFFShoppingLists.</p>
